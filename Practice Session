SESSION-01
=============
SDLC
Waterfall vs Agile vs DevSecOps
What is DevOps?
Linux

SDLC --> Software Development Life cycle

Requirements analysis
Planning
Design --> General requirements to technical requirements
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintainance

Waterfall
===========

SMS --> School Management System

100 years back --> Final exam

stakeholders
============
Teachers -> Not serious to complete syllabus from DAY-1
Parents -> Yes. Worried about whether they pass or not
Students -> Not serious to study from DAY-1

30%

Process Change
============
UNIT TEST-I, II, III, IV
Q, H, PRE-FINAL, Final

UNIT TEST-I --> 30 days
Teachers --> They should be serious from DAY-1 to complete syllabus for UNIT TEST-I
Students --> 1 week before UNIT TEST-I
Parents --> They are waiting for UNIT TEST-I results

80%

Parents --> Clients
Students --> Developers, Operations team or Testing team
Teachers --> IT Management

Waterfall
==========
Requirements -> Phase-I
Once you are in Phase-II
You can't go back and change the requirements

6 months for development --> Testing and Deployment
100 defects --> 10 invalid defects

50 defects --> 6 invalid defects

Ambassdor

Agile
=========
Requirements analysis
Planning
Design --> General requirements to technical requirements
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintainance

Modules --> Signup, Login, Menu, Order, Shipping, Delivery, Payments

Signup --> 1 month

2 weeks for development, 2 weeks for testing and deployment

development is serious from DAY-1

20 defects --> 5 invalid defects

Waterfall --> 10 times testing --> 100
Agile --> 30 times testing --> 101
DevOps --> 100 times --> 102

Agile is part of DevOps
============
Modules --> Signup, Login, Menu, Order, Shipping, Delivery, Payments

Signup
========
1 month
DAY-1 --> 100 lines of code --> enter your first name, enter your last name
deploy this 100 lines --> test this 100 lines

3 defects --> Co-operation, Co-ordination, Collobaration between teams

DAY-10 --> We should deploy and test everything.

DevOps is a process of building, testing and releasing code on the same day when developer writes something. through this process we can acheive colloboration between teams, faster releases and less defects

Speed and Accuracy

DEV, PROD
DEV, QA, PROD
DEV, QA, UAT, PRE-PROD, PROD
DEV, QA, UAT, PERF, SECURITY, PRE-PROD, PROD

Linux
=========
Windows
--------
We need to restart sometimes --> It can run for years
Too many graphics -> Time to load --> No graphics --> Super perfomance
Resource consumption --> Less resource consumtion
Not that much secure --> Secure
Costly --> Free
Not Opensource --> Opensource

Server Creation, Linux Commands, Editors, User creation, Install Softwares, Service management

AWS Account creation

i3, 8GB ram
i5, 16GB
i7, 16GB
